This is Keith's personal website.  It includes a basic JavaScript game, a link to videos that I've created, and basic contact information.

Welcome - Brings the user to the main webpage all the way to the top

Home - Brings the user to the two columns upon clicking the link

News - This is a news feed that is under construction.  The user can fill in infomration in the 'Title' and 'content'
sections.  Upon hitting 'preview' it will post the date on the screen.  This section still needs work.  Would like to setup 
the backend of this page, and make the posts vertical on the page.  

Photos - This uses embeded links from instagram.  'embed.js' is continuing to fail to load (on some pages), and I'm investigating the issue. 
This page will have an assortment of pictures from instagrams, and other posts.

Videos = This page includes videos that my Roommate, and I make called 'The Dapper House'.  It includes embeded links from the youtube
videos, and is formatted using bootstrap.

Games - 
    Bucketballs - this app is still work in progress where when a user clicks a little ball will fire in that direction.
    
    CircleMan - This game includes a basic canvas with a ball that can move in all directors by using the arrow keys, or the 
    buttons on the page.  There is a slight gravity to it, and the ball can't escape the canvas.  This is the basis of a game 
    where you move the ball around.

    Olix The RPG - The begining part of an RPG.  Right now it includes a main html page that is interactive when the user clicks.
    The button utilizes JQuery to animate the text, and begin the process.  This will be a text based RPG.

Contacts - 
    'Keith Frederick' - includes a link with an anchor tag to my linkedin page.  

    'Contact Me' - A basic form to contact me including 'First Name', 'Last Name', 'Email' and a message.  It includes a little bit of
    data validation if the user hits submit, and did not fill out certain sections of the form.
